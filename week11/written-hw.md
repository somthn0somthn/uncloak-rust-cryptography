#Compute with pen and paper, the Elgamal algorithm for Alice sending Bob a message. Use parameters: p=19, g=2, a=3, b=5, m=12. You may choose any k. If an adversary obtained the computed ciphertext (c1,c2), and obtained access to k, how could they decrypt the ciphertext?

#Compute with Shank's algorithm, on pen and paper, the discrete log of (2^x = 33 mod 83) Note that 2 is a generator, which you may check by verifying (2^41 = 82 mod 83) (check that you understand why this works).

#Optional: Implement one or both of Elgamal encryption and/or Shank's algorithm.
