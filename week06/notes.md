-`Ed25519` desinged to have no branches or memory addresses that depend on secret info
-bugs have often occured in software that only tests alphanumeric characters and ignores 0x80 unicode strings
-check for unreachable code during testing
-`SAT solvers` hvae two important limitations: limited to loop-free constraints so can prove correctness for fixed-size inputs only; using SAT solvers is not scalable because constraints become too large

-notorization by certificate authorities could trick client software into uploading malicious update software from the "propietor"

-timing attacks can be carried out remotely
-timing must be considered for each instruction
-spectre-style attacks are particularly difficult to protect against
