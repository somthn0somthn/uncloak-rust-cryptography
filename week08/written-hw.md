## Suppose taht `x mod 30 = 2.` What is obtained about `x mod 2`, `x mod 3`, and `x mod 5`? What about `x mod 7`?

x mod 30 = 2
x mod 2  = 0
x mod 3  = 2
x mod 5  = 2
x mod 7  = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} because 7 is not a divosor of 30

## You're Eve, intercepting  a message from Alice to Bob. Alice asked Bob to choose a prime larger than 30 to construct a prime field. You choose `p = 31, g = 2`. How many unique choices of exponent x in `g^x = a mod p` does Alice now have? A unique choice is any uniquely obtainable values for a. For instance, `2^17 = 4` and `2^32 = 4` are not unique.,

5
1,2,4,8,16,32


## Bob would have chosen `p = 83, g = 2` How many unique choices for x does Alice have now? What if Bob chose `p = 83, g = 3`?

82
41

## 576001 is the prime with factorization `p - 1 = (2^9) * (3^2) * (5^3)`. Find a generator `g != 1` with order `|g| < 10`.

-a `g`that generates an entire group is called a `primitive element`
